        <p>My name is David Beckford, and I am a husband and father to two beautiful girls. Although I'm originally from New Jersey, I have been residing in Charlotte, North Carolina, since 2009. I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with a fiery passion for staying ahead of the curve regarding security threats. As a Cyber Security Management graduate of Strayer University, I've gained a deep understanding of the principles and technologies, technical information, and security concepts that underpin the industry.
        I also have a knack for writing and interpreting policies and procedures, excellent communication skills, and a strong customer service focus. I'm highly organized and independent and can efficiently juggle priorities, even in a fast-paced environment. On top of that, I have a good understanding of blockchain and solidity programming, which means I can provide innovative solutions to businesses looking to incorporate this fascinating technology.
        When I'm not busy with my studies or work, I'm an entrepreneur and the CEO of SoleSzn, a dynamic sneaker reselling company. I've built this business from the ground up, focusing on providing customers with the best exclusive and limited-edition sneakers while prioritizing quality, authenticity, and customer satisfaction. And if that wasn't enough, I also love coaching basketball, leading a team of eight girls to the championship game in 2023. My passion for learning and continuous improvement has driven my success in both my professional and educational pursuits. So, if you're looking for a highly motivated and driven Web Developer/ Cyber Security professional, look no further than me! ~D.A.B.</p>
